<h2>About Me</h2>

  This is Wenxin Liang, but you can also call me Wendy. I'm a 17-year-old rising junior at Lincoln Academy.
  I'm from Xiamen, China,
  and have been living in New York as an international student for two years. <br>

<img src="coodkking.jpg" alt="Club members making Latin American food" style="width:250px;height:300px;margin:20px">

  <p>This is the achievement that I'm most proud of. I started the Global Cultures Club with two friends of mine at school, and became the president this year.
  We host club events twice a month to learn from each other about customs and traditions of different countries over the world.
  We've learned traditional Spanish dance, cooked and tasted Latin American food, hold a Thanksgiving reunion,
  taught Chinese calligraphy for the Lunar New Year, and hosted a school-wide World Language Festival.
  <br>Check out our past events over the year!</p>

<h2>Music</h2>
<p>I've always enjoyed playing musical instruments since very young.
I started to play the keyboard at five and I learned to play the guzheng, a traditional Chinese instrument when I was seven.
I like classical music, but also have found jazz interesting since I started playing the piano and keyboard in my school's jazz band.
